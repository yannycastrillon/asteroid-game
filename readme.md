##Problems
- Managing collision detection regarding each rock and the bullet.
- Managing performance and efficiency of the game when applying the animation of the bullet and the rocks.
- Managing dependencies and responsibilities of each object (Bullet, Rock, Shuttle and Game) and the interaction of messages between them.
- Organization of the code.

##New Features to Accomplish
- Create a welcome screen.
- Sound effects for the bullet and the rocks.
- Sound effect for the shuttle movement.
- Actual description of rock and dialogs between players.
- Shuttle damage calculation.
- Actual ending of the game.
- Refactor code DRY.
